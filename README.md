# Tiny-text-editor

A text editor, yeah. You can compile it and use it pretty much anywhere. 

Default startup screen character size is 50x100 (Lines x Char).

Keybinds:
  ESC -> Save and close the editor
  F1  -> Refresh screen manually
  F2  -> Save file
  F3  -> Debugger
  
Type ? in debugger to show the list of commands.
