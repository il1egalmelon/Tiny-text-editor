# Tiny-text-editor

A text editor, yeah. You can compile it and use it pretty much anywhere. 
The included program.run is compiled with Mono on Ubuntu 22.04. Please do not use it unless you are extremely lazy.

Default startup screen character size is 50x100 (Lines x Char).

Keybinds:

    ESC -> Interactive mode
    I   -> Insert mode
    F1  -> Refresh screen manually
    F2  -> Save file
    F3  -> Debugger
    F4  -> Save and close the editor
  
Type ? in debugger to show the list of commands for the debugger.
